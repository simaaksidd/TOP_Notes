  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Basic syntax includes a selector and property:value pair </p>
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70952936/130702428-4808becb-cbc4-4a4d-8fa7-f9aa5409768d.jpg" alt=""> 
  <h2>Selectors</h2>
  <p>Universal selector: *</p>
  <p>Type Selectors are for html tags like "div" </p>
  <div class="red-text"><p> selectors select every element in the given class</p></div>
  <div class="red-text blue-background"><p>Elements can have multiple classes with whitespace to separate them</p></div>
  <div id="title"><p>ID selectors are similar to class selectors but the element can only have ONE ID</p></div>
  <p>you can group similar property:value pairs together</p>
  <div>
    <div class="subsection header">Chaining selectors is useful when you have multiple class selectors inside a container tag. You can also do this with ID tags</div>
    <p class="subsection preview">Chaining type selectors does not work because a tag cannot have more than one type, i.e. a div cannot be a div and a p at the same time</p>
  </div>
  <!-- Decendent Combinators only select elements which are nested inside the respective class-->
<div class="ancestor"> <!-- A -->
  <div class="contents"> <!-- B -->
    <div class="contents"> <!-- C -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="contents"></div> <!-- D -->
<!--In this example, the Decendent combinator, '.ancestor .contents' would modify elements B and C because they are nested inside the parent class, 'ancestor'-->
<!--Think of the css code as parent first then child then child's child and so on-->

<h2>The Cascade</h2>
<p>Sometimes CSS doesn't do what we want it to do. This may be because of three things: personal error, default browser styles, and the Cascade. The cascade is what determines which rules actually get applied to our HTML. There are different factors that the cascade uses to determine this.</p>
<h3>Specificity</h3>
<p>Sometimes an element will have multiple, conflicting declarations assigned to it, because of this, CSS has an order of <em>Specificity</em>.  The most specific CSS declaration is what the element will go with. Inline styles are the most specific, then all of the selectors we have mentioned follow in this order:</p>
<ol>
  <li>ID selectors (most specific)</li>
  <li>Class selectors</li>
  <li>Type selectors</li>
<p>in the case that the element has an element that shares multiple declarations with the same level of specificity, then the one with more of that selector will take precidence. Ex: 2 class selectors takes precidence over one class selector</p>
</ol>
